# Dictionary Lemmatizer

A plugin for the GATE language technology framework for finding Lemmata for words.

This plugin combines word lists from [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) and, if available, morphological
transducers created for the [Helsinki Finite-State Transducer (FST) software]
(http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/kieliteknologia/tutkimus/hfst/) to find lemmata for tokens.

Currently, the following languages are supported:
* en (English)
* de (German)
* fr (French)
* it (Italian)
* nl (Dutch)
* es (Spanish)

The input for the PR must already be tokenized and every token must have a Penn Treebank POS tag as a feature.

This plugin is partly based on the [code](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/A.Aker/activityNLPProjects.html)
developed by [Ahmet Aker](https://www.is.inf.uni-due.de/staff/aker.html.de) for POS tagging and lemmatization in several
languages.
